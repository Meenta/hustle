# Meenta Hustle Tests
Welcome to our hustle tests. This repo contains a growing number of standalone
features and challenges that we ask people to review. Please feel free to choose
the one you like the most. This is real work for features that are either in
development or on our roadmap.

A few things to keep in mind:
- Perfect is not required.
- Use the internet to find what you need.
- Ask us for help or feedback.
- Do your own work.
- Document future work with // TODO in the code.

The problem descriptions are not complete. We want you figure out what the
problem is and build the solution you envision.

### Problems
- [UI for Profile Component](/ui/README.md)
- [Firebase Testing Harness](/firebase/README.md)

### How to Get Started
Please use this repo for all your work. Start by cloning the repo
to your own account. Review the problems and do the work for the one
you choose in the problem folder. Commit your code and any writeup in
a `RESULTS.md` file in the same folder.

When you are done, let us know and we can schedule a time to talk.
Remember perfection is the goal, we are looking for __vision__, __direction__ and __hustle__.

Show your work, document issues or to-do items, and be ready
to talk about your approach.

Thanks!
