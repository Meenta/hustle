# Product Owner Test
This hustle test is for the Product Owners position. This is a real problem.
There are no `right` answers. Unlike the UI and Server tests this is more of
thought and presentation challenge. No coding needed.

The slides are required prior to being selected for the final interview.

### Introduction & Background
We are moving our stack to a `micro-features` pattern. This means that
each feature in our application resided in its own git repo, and contains
a suite of web components and services that support it. These `features`
are design to allow a product owner to mix-and-match functionality within
single page applications (SPA).

Currently we are building out a suite of `search` related web components
that we can combine with landing pages, copy and usage cases to learn
how our customers approach finding the sequencing resources they need to
solve their research objectives.

The link below points to a prototype SPA that is designed to help a `newbie`
users by providing them with an NGS (Next Generation Sequencing) calculator.
The `calculator` component allows a scientists to enter the specifics of
their experiment. The application then allows them see recommendations for
instruments that will meet their requirements.

The SPA contains four components; `search form`, `profile`, `quotes` and `results table`.

### Happy Path
A user visits this page, enters in their experimental requirements. The user
reviews the results, and selects an individual instrument. The SPA allows the
user to see details, and add a given instrument to a quote. Quotes can be
reviewed and downloaded. A user needs to have an account (use the following to
test.)

Username: `john.doe@meenta.io` Password: `meenta123`

### Deliverables
Present a 2-week product sprint with a 3 person development team for
`search` deliverable(s)".  Show 5-10 slides showing requirements gathered,
methodology used, OKR/KPR ranking of feature builds / prioritization, and
finally a development plan of responsibilities, appendix of deep dives optional.  

Expect to have 15 minutes to present, allowing for 15 minutes of Q&A.

Thought Questions:
- How would you think about this product and its components?
- How would you approach vetting the copy and features?
- How have you approached new features?
- What resources would you need to provide a roadmap?
